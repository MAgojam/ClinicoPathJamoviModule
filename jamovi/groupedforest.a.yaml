    Creates grouped hazard regression forest plots to show treatment vs control comparisons
    across different variants or subgroups. This module performs Cox proportional hazards
    regression separately for each subgroup defined by a grouping variable and presents
    the hazard ratios in a single forest plot. Perfect for showing treatment effects
    across patient variants, genetic subtypes, or clinical subgroups.

    usage: |
      # Example:
      # 1. Load survival data with time, event, treatment, and subgroup variables.
      # 2. Select time variable (follow-up duration).
      # 3. Select event variable (outcome/death indicator).
      # 4. Select treatment variable (treatment vs control).
      # 5. Select grouping variable (variants/subgroups for comparison).
      # 6. Run grouped forest plot analysis to compare treatment effects across groups.

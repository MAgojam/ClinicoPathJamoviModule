    main: |
        Calculates positive and negative predictive values for screening and diagnostic tests
        using Bayes' theorem. Demonstrates how disease probability changes with sequential 
        testing and provides Fagan nomograms for clinical decision-making.
        
        This calculator is particularly useful for:
        • Understanding screening test performance in different prevalence settings
        • Sequential testing scenarios (confirmatory testing)
        • Teaching Bayesian probability concepts in medical decision-making
        • Evaluating diagnostic test chains in clinical workflows

    Checks DOIs against retraction databases to identify retracted publications.
    Uses OpenRetractions API to validate publication status and can optionally
    retrieve PubMed IDs. Includes DOI format validation, rate limiting, and 
    robust error handling for reliable results.
  R:

      # Example 1: Basic retraction check
      data <- data.frame(
        doi = c("10.1126/science.aac4716", "10.1038/nature12373", "10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.045")

        data = data, 
        doi = "doi",
        pmid = TRUE
      )
      
      # Example 3: Using different database

            The data as a data frame containing the DOI variable to check. 
            Must have at least one column with DOI strings.

      title: DOI Variable
      type: Variable
      description:
          R: >
            Column containing DOI strings to check for retractions. Supports
            multiple DOI formats including bare DOIs (10.1000/example), 
            DOI URIs (doi:10.1000/example), and DOI URLs (https://doi.org/10.1000/example).

            Database to check for retractions. OpenRetractions is recommended 
            as it provides comprehensive and up-to-date retraction information. 
            RetractionWatch option currently uses OpenRetractions as fallback.

            If TRUE, attempts to retrieve corresponding PubMed IDs for valid DOIs
            using the rcrossref package. Requires internet connection and may 
            increase processing time for large datasets.

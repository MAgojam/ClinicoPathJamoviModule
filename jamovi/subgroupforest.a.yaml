    main: >
        Creates forest plots showing treatment effects across different patient subgroups.
        Performs subgroup analysis for clinical trials and observational studies,
        calculating treatment effects within patient subgroups and testing for interactions.
        Supports survival (time-to-event), binary, and continuous outcomes with
        comprehensive statistical validation and heterogeneity testing.

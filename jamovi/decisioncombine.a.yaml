    main: |
        Combines multiple medical diagnostic tests and evaluates their collective 
        performance using different combination rules. This function is essential 
        for optimizing diagnostic accuracy when multiple tests are available for 
        the same condition. Supports OR logic (positive if any test is positive), 
        AND logic (positive only if all tests are positive), and majority rule 
        (positive if more than half of tests are positive). Calculates comprehensive 
        diagnostic performance metrics including sensitivity, specificity, positive 
        and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios, and post-test probabilities 
        for the combined test strategy. Useful for developing optimal test panels 
        and understanding how multiple diagnostic tests perform together.

            "all" means positive only if all tests are positive (AND), and "majority" means
            positive if more than half of tests are positive.

    main: >-
      Analyzes staging system changes and the "Will Rogers Phenomenon" in disease staging. 
      This analysis compares staging distributions before and after a staging system change,
      quantifies stage migration, and evaluates changes in prognostic performance.
    R:
        dontrun: true
        usage: |
            # Example analyzing migration between TNM staging editions:
            # stagemigration(
            #   data = patient_data,
            #   oldStage = "tnm7_stage", 
            #   newStage = "tnm8_stage",
            #   survivalTime = "follow_up_months",
            #   event = "death_status",
            #   eventLevel = "Dead"

            The dataset containing staging and survival information.

    # Stage Migration Variables
    - name: oldStage
      title: 'Original Stage'
      type: Variable
      suggested: [ ordinal, nominal ]
      permitted: [ factor ]
      description: >-
        The original staging variable. This represents the staging system used before
        the revision or change (e.g., TNM 7th edition).

    - name: newStage
      title: 'New Stage'
      type: Variable
      suggested: [ ordinal, nominal ]
      permitted: [ factor ]
      description: >-
        The new staging variable. This represents the revised or changed staging system
        (e.g., TNM 8th edition).

    # Survival Variables
    - name: survivalTime
      title: 'Survival Time'
      type: Variable
      suggested: [ continuous ]
      permitted: [ numeric ]
      description: >-
        The survival or follow-up time variable. This should be a numeric variable
        representing time in consistent units (e.g., months).

    - name: event
      title: 'Event'
      type: Variable
      suggested: [ ordinal, nominal, continuous ]
      permitted: [ factor, numeric ]
      description: >-
        The event indicator variable. This can be a factor or numeric variable indicating
        whether the event of interest (e.g., death) occurred.

    - name: eventLevel
      title: Event Level
      type: Level
      variable: (event)
      description: >-
        The level of the event variable that indicates the event occurred. This is required
        if the event variable is a factor.

    # Plot Options
    - name: plotMigration
      title: "Show Migration Plot"
      type: Bool
      default: true
      description: >-
        Enable to display an alluvial/Sankey plot visualizing stage migration patterns.
        This plot shows how patients move between stages in the old and new systems.

    - name: survivalPlotType
      title: "Survival Plot Type"
      type: List
      options:
        - title: "Separate plots for each staging system"
          name: separate
        - title: "Side by side comparison of staging systems"
          name: sidebyside
      default: separate
      description: >-
        Controls how survival curves are displayed for comparing staging systems.
        "Separate" shows full KM plots for each system, while "Side by side" 
        focuses on direct stage comparisons.

    - name: showCI
      title: "Show Confidence Intervals"
      type: Bool
      default: false
      description: >-
        Enable to display 95% confidence intervals around survival curves.

    # Output Options
    - name: showWillRogers
      title: "Analyze Will Rogers Phenomenon"
      type: Bool
      default: true
      description: >-
        Enable to perform detailed analysis of the Will Rogers phenomenon. This will
        compare survival within stages between patients who migrated and those who didn't.

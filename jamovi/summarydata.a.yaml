    This module generates descriptive statistics for continuous variables.
    It provides both a textual summary and a visually appealing summary table.
    Optionally, you can enable distribution diagnostics to examine normality, skewness, and kurtosis.
  R:
    dontrun: true
    usage: |
      # Example:
      # 1. Load your data frame.
      # 2. Select one or more continuous variables.
      # 3. (Optional) Enable Distribution Diagnostics to view additional tests.
      # 4. Run the summarydata module to see descriptive statistics and distribution characteristics.

    main: >-
        Advanced statistical tests using functions from the DescTools package.
        Includes effect size calculations (Cohen's D), goodness-of-fit tests 
        (Hosmer-Lemeshow, Anderson-Darling), agreement tests (Barnard, Breslow-Day),
        and trend tests (Cochran-Armitage). Essential for clinical research,
        epidemiological studies, and advanced statistical analysis.

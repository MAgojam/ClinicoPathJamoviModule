    main: >-
        Creates professional coefficient plots (forest plots) for regression models.
        Visualizes coefficients and confidence intervals from linear, logistic, and 
        Cox regression models. Supports multiple models comparison, custom coefficient
        selection, standardized coefficients, and various styling options. Essential 
        for presenting regression results in clinical research and epidemiological studies.

This is an R package for clinicopathological research. It has a large number of dependencies, suggesting a wide range of statistical and visualization capabilities. The package seems to be well-documented, with a `VignetteBuilder` and multiple URLs for documentation and bug reports.

This project is a jamovi module for clinicopathological research. It provides a wide range of statistical analyses and visualizations, including:

*   **Descriptive Statistics:** `summarydata`, `tableone`, `gtsummary`
*   **Agreement and Reliability:** `agreement`, `icccoeff`, `kappasizeci`
*   **Survival Analysis:** `survival`, `comparingsurvival`, `multisurvival`, `onesurvival`
*   **Diagnostic Tests:** `roc`, `decisioncurve`, `screeningcalculator`
*   **Data Visualization:** `advancedbarplot`, `raincloud`, `waterfall`, `swimmerplot`
*   **Data Quality and Preprocessing:** `checkdata`, `missingdata`, `datecorrection`

The project is well-structured and appears to be actively maintained. The use of `jamovi` suggests a focus on providing a user-friendly interface for these complex analyses.

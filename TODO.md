  1. Sankey Diagram Fix (High Priority)

- You mentioned earlier: "sankey diagram is not generated" and "we'll work on sankey later"
- The option is currently commented out in the YAML file
- This needs the flow visualization working properly

  2. Dashboard Explanations (Medium Priority)

- From your screenshot, you noted abbreviations like "TBD", "N/A" need explanatory output
- The comparative analysis dashboard shows many "TBD" values that need explanation
- Users need to understand what each abbreviation means

  3. Validation & Testing (Medium Priority)

- Ensure all Will Rogers features work correctly after the plot fix
- Test the enhanced statistical analysis functions
- Validate the advanced migration analysis workflow

  4. Additional Advanced Features (Lower Priority)

  Based on the comprehensive module capabilities, potential enhancements could include:

- Bootstrap validation results display
- Cross-validation implementation
- Decision curve analysis visualization
- Calibration plots implementation
- ROC curve comparison plots
- Forest plot for hazard ratios





For Will Rogers Effect Analysis, we need to ensure the following features are implemented:
Formal Statistical Test
- No specific statistical test (like log-rank) comparing:
  - Original stage survival with vs. without migrated patients
  - New stage survival with vs. without migrated patients
- No p-values for determining if improvements are statistically significant

For Will Rogers Effect Analysis, we need to ensure the following features are implemented:
Detailed Stage-Specific Analysis
- No breakdown showing how each stage's survival improves after losing worst patients/gaining better patients
- No quantification of artificial survival improvement percentages

  2. Monotonicity Checks
  Ensure stages maintain proper ordering (higher stage = worse survival):

# Check if median survival decreases monotonically with stage

  check_monotonicity <- function(survival_by_stage) {
    all(diff(survival_by_stage) < 0)
  }

  3. Stage-Specific C-index
  Calculate C-index within each old stage category to ensure the new system is prognostic within subgroups:

# C-index for new staging within each old stage

  for (old_stage in unique(data$old_stage)) {
    subset_data <- data[data$old_stage == old_stage, ]
    c_index_within <- concordance(Surv(time, status) ~ new_stage, data = subset_data)
  }

  4. Likelihood Ratio Chi-square Comparison
  More emphasis on LR χ² as a key metric:

# Extract and compare LR chi-square values

  lr_chi2_old <- summary(cox_model_old)$logtest["test"]
  lr_chi2_new <- summary(cox_model_new)$logtest["test"]

  5. Proportion of Variation Explained (Pseudo R²)
  Already partially implemented, but could add more variants:

- Nagelkerke R²
- Cox & Snell R²
- Royston & Sauerbrei R²

check if this feature is implemented?
  6. Calibration Plots
  Show observed vs. expected survival by stage:

# Calibration assessment

  library(rms)
  calibrate_plot <- function(cox_model, times = c(12, 24, 60)) {
    cal <- calibrate(cox_model, u = times, B = 200)
    plot(cal)
  }

  7. Stage Migration Impact Visualization
  Create specialized plots showing:

- Sankey diagram of patient flow between stages
- Before/after survival curves with confidence bands
- Migration impact on stage-specific survival

check if this feature is implemented?
  8. Bootstrap Validation
  Add bootstrap confidence intervals for all metrics:

# Bootstrap C-index difference

  bootstrap_c_diff <- function(data, n_boot = 1000) {
    boot_results <- replicate(n_boot, {
      boot_idx <- sample(nrow(data), replace = TRUE)
      boot_data <- data[boot_idx, ]
      c_old <- concordance(Surv(time, status) ~ old_stage, data = boot_data)$concordance
      c_new <- concordance(Surv(time, status) ~ new_stage, data = boot_data)$concordance
      c_new - c_old
    })
    quantile(boot_results, c(0.025, 0.975))
  }

  9. Reclassification Quality Metrics
  Beyond NRI, add:

- Category-specific NRI (upstaging vs. downstaging)
- Clinical NRI (based on treatment thresholds)
- Weighted NRI (giving more importance to high-risk patients)

check if this feature is implemented?
  10. Comparative Analysis Dashboard
  A comprehensive summary table including:

- All discrimination metrics (C-index, AUC variants)
- All calibration metrics
- Model fit statistics (AIC, BIC, LR χ²)
- Reclassification metrics (NRI, IDI)
- Clinical utility metrics

did we implement following?

  1. Schoenfeld Residuals Testing for Proportional Hazards Assumption

# Verify proportional hazards assumption

  cox.zph(cox_model)

- Why important: Critical validation requirement mentioned in the document
- Implementation: Add to advanced migration analysis
- Clinical value: Ensures Cox model assumptions are met

did we implement following?
  2. Time-dependent ROC Analysis with AUC Curves

- Already partially implemented but could be enhanced with integrated AUC measures
- Enhancement: Add integrated Brier score combining calibration and discrimination
- Package reference: timeROC package mentioned in document

did we implement following?
  3. Decision Curve Analysis (DCA)

# Net benefit analysis preferred over NRI/IDI

- Why important: Document specifically recommends DCA over traditional reclassification metrics
- Implementation: Add as alternative to/complement of NRI/IDI
- Clinical value: Assesses clinical utility across different threshold probabilities

  7. Stage Migration Impact Visualization
  Create specialized plots showing:
- Sankey diagram of patient flow between stages
- Before/after survival curves with confidence bands
- Migration impact on stage-specific survival

  8. Bootstrap Validation
  Add bootstrap confidence intervals for all metrics:
Bootstrap C-index difference
  bootstrap_c_diff <- function(data, n_boot = 1000) {
    boot_results <- replicate(n_boot, {
      boot_idx <- sample(nrow(data), replace = TRUE)
      boot_data <- data[boot_idx, ]
      c_old <- concordance(Surv(time, status) ~ old_stage, data = boot_data)$concordance
      c_new <- concordance(Surv(time, status) ~ new_stage, data = boot_data)$concordance
      c_new - c_old
    })
    quantile(boot_results, c(0.025, 0.975))
  }

  9. Reclassification Quality Metrics
  Beyond NRI, add:
- Category-specific NRI (upstaging vs. downstaging)
- Clinical NRI (based on treatment thresholds)
- Weighted NRI (giving more importance to high-risk patients)

  10. Comparative Analysis Dashboard
  A comprehensive summary table including:
- All discrimination metrics (C-index, AUC variants)
- All calibration metrics
- Model fit statistics (AIC, BIC, LR χ²)
- Reclassification metrics (NRI, IDI)
- Clinical utility metrics

did we implement following?
  1. Schoenfeld Residuals Testing for Proportional Hazards Assumption
Verify proportional hazards assumption
  cox.zph(cox_model)
- Why important: Critical validation requirement mentioned in the document
- Implementation: Add to advanced migration analysis
- Clinical value: Ensures Cox model assumptions are met

did we implement following?
  2. Time-dependent ROC Analysis with AUC Curves
- Already partially implemented but could be enhanced with integrated AUC measures
- Enhancement: Add integrated Brier score combining calibration and discrimination
- Package reference: timeROC package mentioned in document

did we implement following?
  3. Decision Curve Analysis (DCA)
Net benefit analysis preferred over NRI/IDI
- Why important: Document specifically recommends DCA over traditional reclassification metrics
- Implementation: Add as alternative to/complement of NRI/IDI
- Clinical value: Assesses clinical utility across different threshold probabilities

did we implement following?
  4. Calibration Assessment Enhancements
- Current: Basic calibration analysis
- Enhancement: Add calibration slopes and flexible spline-based curves
- Target: Calibration slope of 1 indicates perfect calibration

did we implement following?
  5. Multi-institutional Validation Approaches
- Method: Internal-external cross-validation
- Implementation: Use k-1 centers for development, validate on remaining center
- Consideration: Requires multi-center data structure

did we implement following?
  6. Competing Risks Analysis
- Package: cmprsk for Fine-Gray models
- Use case: When multiple event types can occur
- Implementation: Optional advanced analysis

did we implement following?
  7. Advanced R² Measures for Survival Data
- Enhancement: Add more comprehensive pseudo R² variants
- Current: We have Nagelkerke, Cox & Snell, McFadden, Royston & Sauerbrei
- Potential additions: Likelihood ratio R², explained variation measures

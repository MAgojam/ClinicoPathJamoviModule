# R files

Fix _updateModules.R legacy copying options. Only list the current available files. Remove depreciated removed file names from the list. Make the functionto run only via config file

for-utils.R vs. utils.R - check these functions and combine them under one utils function.

diagnostic_metrics.R - check if the contents of this file is used. if they are used add them to relevant domain copy file list in config file.

for_jjstatsplot.R - check if the contents of this file is used.

testroc_utilities.R - check if the contents of this file is used.

utils-pipe.R utils-pipe2.R - pipe utilities check these functions and combine them under one utils function.

tumor_response_examples.R - tumor response examples (data generation) move to relevant folder

ClinicoPath-package.R - impreove package documentation

psychopdaroc_utilities.R - psychopdaroc utilities add them to relevant domain copy file list

nomogrammer.R - nomogram functions add them to relevant domain copy file list

# Stage Migration

## Option 1: Migration Summary Table

This could complement our current tables by providing statistical test results for the migration patterns:

Chi-square test p-values

Fisher's exact test results

Migration rate statistics

Would round out the basic migration analysis

## Option 2: Statistical Comparison Table

This would add C-index comparisons between staging systems:

Harrell's C-index for both systems

Confidence intervals

Statistical significance tests

Essential for staging validation

### Option 3: Concordance Comparison

Detailed discrimination metrics:

More comprehensive than Statistical Comparison

Multiple concordance measures

Deeper statistical validation

#### Option 4: Focus on Advanced Methods

Enable some of the more sophisticated analyses:

NRI (Net Reclassification Improvement)

IDI (Integrated Discrimination Improvement)

ROC Analysis

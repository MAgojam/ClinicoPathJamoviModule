  Based on the current foundation, here are the logical next steps:

  Option 1: Migration Summary Table

  This could complement our current tables by providing statistical test results for the migration patterns:

- Chi-square test p-values
- Fisher's exact test results
- Migration rate statistics
- Would round out the basic migration analysis

  Option 2: Statistical Comparison Table

  This would add C-index comparisons between staging systems:

- Harrell's C-index for both systems
- Confidence intervals
- Statistical significance tests
- Essential for staging validation

  Option 3: Concordance Comparison

  Detailed discrimination metrics:

- More comprehensive than Statistical Comparison
- Multiple concordance measures
- Deeper statistical validation

  Option 4: Focus on Advanced Methods

  Enable some of the more sophisticated analyses:

- NRI (Net Reclassification Improvement)
- IDI (Integrated Discrimination Improvement)
- ROC Analysis

  What would you like to focus on next?

  1. Add Migration Summary as a 4th default table?
  2. Test Statistical/Concordance Comparison tables?
  3. Jump to advanced methods like NRI/IDI?
  4. Work on plot implementation?
  5. Something else specific?

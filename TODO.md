# Stage Migration

add multivariables, then compare multivariable models that include original and new stage

## Option 1: Migration Summary Table

This could complement our current tables by providing statistical test results for the migration patterns:

Chi-square test p-values

Fisher's exact test results

Migration rate statistics

Would round out the basic migration analysis

## Option 2: Statistical Comparison Table

This would add C-index comparisons between staging systems:

Harrell's C-index for both systems

Confidence intervals

Statistical significance tests

Essential for staging validation

## Option 3: Concordance Comparison

Detailed discrimination metrics:

More comprehensive than Statistical Comparison

Multiple concordance measures

Deeper statistical validation

## Option 4: Focus on Advanced Methods

Enable some of the more sophisticated analyses:

NRI (Net Reclassification Improvement)

IDI (Integrated Discrimination Improvement)

ROC Analysis

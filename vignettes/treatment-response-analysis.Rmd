## Introduction

Treatment response analysis is crucial in oncology research for evaluating therapeutic efficacy and understanding patient outcomes. This vignette demonstrates specialized functions in ClinicoPathDescriptives for analyzing treatment response data, including waterfall plots, swimmer plots, and RECIST criteria implementation.

## Oncology Response Evaluation

### RECIST Criteria

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) provides standardized guidelines for measuring treatment response:

- **Complete Response (CR)**: Disappearance of all target lesions
- **Partial Response (PR)**: ≥30% decrease in sum of target lesion diameters
- **Progressive Disease (PD)**: ≥20% increase in sum of target lesion diameters
- **Stable Disease (SD)**: Neither PR nor PD criteria met

```{r setup}
library(ClinicoPath)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

# Load both datasets
data(treatmentResponse)
data(histopathology)

# Examine treatment response data structure
head(treatmentResponse)
summary(treatmentResponse$ResponseValue)
```

## Dataset Preparation

```{r}
# Create comprehensive treatment response dataset
response_data <- treatmentResponse %>%
  mutate(
    # RECIST classification based on percentage change
    RECIST_Response = case_when(
      is.na(ResponseValue) ~ "Not Evaluable",
      ResponseValue <= -30 ~ "Partial Response (PR)",
      ResponseValue > -30 & ResponseValue < 20 ~ "Stable Disease (SD)",
      ResponseValue >= 20 ~ "Progressive Disease (PD)"
    ),
    # Additional response categories
    Response_Category = case_when(
      is.na(ResponseValue) ~ "Missing",
      ResponseValue < 0 ~ "Tumor Shrinkage",
      ResponseValue == 0 ~ "No Change",
      ResponseValue > 0 ~ "Tumor Growth"
    ),
    # Best response categories
    Best_Response = case_when(
      ResponseValue <= -50 ~ "Major Response",
      ResponseValue <= -30 ~ "Partial Response",
      ResponseValue > -30 & ResponseValue < 20 ~ "Stable Disease",
      ResponseValue >= 20 & ResponseValue < 50 ~ "Progressive Disease",
      ResponseValue >= 50 ~ "Rapid Progression",
      TRUE ~ "Not Evaluable"
    ),
    # Extract patient number for sorting
    PatientNum = as.numeric(gsub("PT", "", PatientID))
  ) %>%
  arrange(ResponseValue)

# Summary statistics
cat("Treatment Response Dataset Summary:\n")
cat("Total Patients:", nrow(response_data), "\n")
cat("Evaluable Patients:", sum(!is.na(response_data$ResponseValue)), "\n")
cat("Missing Data:", sum(is.na(response_data$ResponseValue)), "\n\n")

# Response distribution
table(response_data$RECIST_Response)
```

## Basic Response Analysis

### Response Distribution

```{r}
# Analyze response categories
reportcat(
  data = response_data,
  vars = c("RECIST_Response", "Best_Response", "Response_Category"),
  title = "Treatment Response Distribution"
)
```

### Summary Statistics by Response Category

```{r}
# Continuous variable summary by response
summarydata(
  data = response_data,
  vars = "ResponseValue",
  group = "RECIST_Response",
  title = "Response Value Distribution by RECIST Category"
)
```

## Waterfall Plot Analysis

The waterfall plot is the gold standard for visualizing individual patient treatment responses in oncology trials.

```{r}
# Basic waterfall plot
waterfall(
  data = response_data,
  patient_id = "PatientID",
  response = "ResponseValue",
  title = "Individual Patient Treatment Responses",
  subtitle = "Percentage Change from Baseline"
)
```

### Advanced Waterfall Plot with Response Categories

```{r}
# Create waterfall with color coding by response category
waterfall(
  data = response_data,
  patient_id = "PatientID", 
  response = "ResponseValue",
  group = "RECIST_Response",
  title = "Treatment Response by RECIST Criteria",
  subtitle = "Color-coded by Response Category"
)
```

## Swimmer Plot Analysis

Swimmer plots show individual patient timelines, treatment durations, and clinical events over time.

```{r}
# Prepare data for swimmer plot by merging with clinical data
# Create synthetic timeline data based on available information
swimmer_data <- histopathology %>%
  select(ID, Group, OverallTime, Outcome, Death, TStage, Grade) %>%
  mutate(
    PatientID = paste0("PT", sprintf("%04d", ID)),
    Treatment_Duration = pmax(1, OverallTime * runif(n(), 0.6, 1.0)), # Synthetic treatment duration
    Event_Time = ifelse(Outcome == 1, OverallTime, NA),
    Response_Time = Treatment_Duration * runif(n(), 0.3, 0.8), # Synthetic response assessment time
    Treatment_Status = case_when(
      Death == "DOĞRU" ~ "Discontinued - Death",
      Outcome == 1 ~ "Discontinued - Progression", 
      TRUE ~ "Ongoing"
    )
  ) %>%
  filter(ID <= 50) %>%  # Limit to first 50 patients for clarity
  arrange(desc(OverallTime))

# Generate swimmer plot
swimmerplot(
  data = swimmer_data,
  patient_id = "PatientID",
  treatment_duration = "Treatment_Duration",
  overall_time = "OverallTime",
  group = "Group",
  title = "Patient Treatment Timelines",
  subtitle = "Individual Patient Follow-up and Treatment Duration"
)
```

## Response Correlation Analysis

### Response by Patient Characteristics

```{r}

      mutate(PatientID = paste0("PT", sprintf("%04d", ID))),
    by = "PatientID"
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Group))  # Keep only patients with clinical data

# Response by treatment group
crosstable(
  data = combined_data,

  mutate(
    Age_Group = case_when(
      Age < 50 ~ "< 50 years",
      Age >= 50 ~ "≥ 50 years"
    ),
    High_Grade = ifelse(Grade == "3", "Grade 3", "Grade 1-2")
  )

# Response by age group
summarydata(
  data = response_magnitude,
  vars = "ResponseValue",
  group = "Age_Group",
  title = "Response Magnitude by Age Group"
)
```

```{r}

    by = "PatientID"
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(MeasurementA) & !is.na(ResponseValue)) %>%
  mutate(
    MeasurementA_Level = ifelse(MeasurementA > median(MeasurementA), "High", "Low"),
    MeasurementB_Level = ifelse(MeasurementB > median(MeasurementB), "High", "Low")
  )

# Response by biomarker levels
crosstable(
  data = biomarker_response,

    SD_Count = sum(RECIST_Response == "Stable Disease (SD)"),
    PD_Count = sum(RECIST_Response == "Progressive Disease (PD)"),
    Overall_Response_Rate = round(PR_Count / Total_Patients * 100, 1),
    Disease_Control_Rate = round((PR_Count + SD_Count) / Total_Patients * 100, 1),
    Progressive_Disease_Rate = round(PD_Count / Total_Patients * 100, 1),
    .groups = 'drop'

kable(response_rates,
      caption = "Treatment Response Rates by Study Group",
      col.names = c("Group", "Total", "PR", "SD", "PD", 
                    "ORR (%)", "DCR (%)", "PDR (%)"))

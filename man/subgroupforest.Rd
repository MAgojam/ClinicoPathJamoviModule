}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame.}

\item{outcome}{Primary outcome variable. For survival analysis, this should
be the time variable. For binary outcomes, use 0/1 or factor with 2 levels.
For continuous outcomes, use numeric variables.}

\item{treatment}{Treatment or exposure variable (must be binary: 0/1,
control/treatment). This variable defines the two groups being compared in
the analysis.}

\item{subgroups}{Variables defining patient subgroups for analysis
(categorical variables). Each variable will be analyzed separately to
identify differential treatment effects. Examples: age groups, gender,
disease stage, biomarker status.}

\item{time}{Time variable for survival analysis (numeric, required if
outcomeType = "survival"). Should contain time to event or censoring in
consistent units (days, months, years).}

\item{event}{Event indicator for survival analysis (binary: 1=event
occurred, 0=censored). Required for survival analysis to distinguish
between observed events and censored observations.}

\item{outcomeType}{Type of outcome variable: "survival" (time-to-event),
"binary" (yes/no), "continuous". Determines the statistical method used for
analysis (Cox regression, logistic regression, linear regression).}

\item{effectMeasure}{Statistical measure for treatment effect: "hr" (hazard
ratio), "or" (odds ratio),  "rr" (risk ratio), "md" (mean difference).
Should match the outcome type.}

\item{confidenceLevel}{Confidence level for intervals.}

\item{showOverall}{Display overall treatment effect across all patients.}

\item{showInteraction}{Perform statistical tests for subgroup interactions
using likelihood ratio tests. Tests whether treatment effect varies
significantly across subgroups.}

\item{sortBy}{Method for ordering subgroups in the plot: "effect" (by
effect size),  "n" (by sample size), "alpha" (alphabetical). Affects visual
presentation.}

\item{showSampleSizes}{Display sample sizes for each subgroup.}

\item{logScale}{Display effects on log scale (recommended for ratios: HR,
OR, RR). Makes ratio effects more interpretable and symmetric around null
value.}

\item{nullLine}{Value for null effect reference line (1 for ratios:
HR/OR/RR, 0 for differences: MD). Vertical line indicating no treatment
effect.}

\description{
Creates forest plots showing treatment effects across different patient
subgroups. Performs subgroup analysis for clinical trials and observational
studies, calculating treatment effects within patient subgroups and testing
for interactions. Supports survival (time-to-event), binary, and continuous
outcomes with comprehensive statistical validation and heterogeneity
testing.

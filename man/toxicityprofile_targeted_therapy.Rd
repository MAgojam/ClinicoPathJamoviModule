\title{Targeted Therapy Safety Profile Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 1,142 adverse events from 200 patients and 8 variables:

\item{treatment_group}{Factor. Treatment regimen ("Monotherapy", "Combination")}
\item{adverse_event}{Factor. Targeted therapy-specific adverse events (24 unique events)}
\item{toxicity_grade}{Integer. CTCAE grade with targeted therapy-specific patterns}
\item{system_organ_class}{Factor. MedDRA SOC emphasizing targeted therapy effects}
\item{time_to_event}{Integer. Days to AE onset (typically early, 1-365 days)}

\description{
Simulated targeted therapy clinical trial adverse event dataset featuring characteristic
targeted therapy toxicities, early onset patterns, and class-specific effects. Designed
to test targeted therapy safety analysis, mechanism-based toxicity profiling, and
kinase inhibitor safety monitoring typical in precision oncology.
}
\details{
This dataset simulates targeted therapy safety data with characteristic class effects,
early onset patterns, and mechanism-based toxicity profiles. It reflects real-world
targeted therapy safety experience including kinase inhibitor effects, EGFR inhibitor
toxicities, and angiogenesis inhibitor-related events.

\strong{Clinical Context:}
\itemize{
\item Targeted therapy trial comparing monotherapy vs combination
\item 200 patients with targeted therapy-specific toxicity focus
\item 24 mechanism-based adverse events
\item Early onset patterns typical of targeted agents
\item Class-specific toxicity distributions
}

\strong{Targeted Therapy-Specific Adverse Events:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Gastrointestinal}: Diarrhea, Mucositis, Nausea, Vomiting
\item \strong{Dermatologic}: Rash, Acneiform rash, Paronychia, Dry skin, Hand-foot syndrome
\item \strong{Constitutional}: Fatigue, Decreased appetite
\item \strong{Cardiovascular}: Hypertension, QT prolongation
\item \strong{Vascular}: Bleeding, Thrombosis, Proteinuria
\item \strong{Hepatic}: Elevated transaminases, Hyperbilirubinemia
\item \strong{Pulmonary}: Pneumonitis, Interstitial lung disease
\item \strong{Other}: Peripheral edema, Pleural effusion, Muscle spasms, Arthralgia
}

\strong{Key Features:}
\itemize{
\item Early onset patterns characteristic of targeted agents
\item Higher frequency of dermatologic and GI toxicities
\item Cardiovascular effects typical of angiogenesis inhibitors
\item Appropriate grade distributions for each toxicity class
\item Realistic incidence rates based on clinical experience
}

\strong{Recommended Analysis Scenarios:}
\itemize{
\item Targeted therapy toxicity profiling
\item Class effect identification and analysis
\item Early vs late onset toxicity patterns
\item Dermatologic toxicity monitoring
\item Cardiovascular safety assessment
\item Dose modification analysis
}

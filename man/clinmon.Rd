\usage{
clinmon(
  data,
  time_var,
  abp,
  mcav,
  icp,
  cpp,
  hr,
  freq = 1000,
  blocksize = 3,

\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame with continuous monitoring data.
First column must be time in seconds, followed by physiological variables.}

\item{time_var}{Time variable in seconds. This should be the first column
and contain  continuous time measurements from the monitoring system.}

\item{abp}{Arterial blood pressure measurements in mmHg. Used for
calculating  multiple hemodynamic indices including PRx, Mx, Sx, Dx, CVRi,
and COest.}

\item{mcav}{Middle cerebral artery blood velocity measurements. Used for
calculating Mx, Sx, Dx, CVRi, PI, and RI indices.}

\item{icp}{Intracranial pressure measurements in mmHg. Used for calculating
PRx and CPPopt indices when combined with arterial blood pressure.}

\item{cpp}{Cerebral perfusion pressure measurements in mmHg. Alternative to
ICP for calculating Mx, Sx, and Dx indices.}

\item{hr}{Heart rate measurements in beats per minute. Used for calculating
estimated cardiac output (COest).}

\item{freq}{Frequency of recorded data in Hz. Default is 1000 Hz for
high-resolution monitoring systems. Adjust based on your data collection
frequency.}

\item{blocksize}{Length of a block in seconds. Blocks are the fundamental
units for calculating indices. Default is 3 seconds.}

\item{epochsize}{Size of epochs in number of blocks. Epochs aggregate
multiple blocks for correlation-based indices. Default is 20 blocks.}

\item{output_level}{Select what each output row should represent: - Period:
Analysis periods (requires trigger data) - Epoch: Epoch-level results
(correlation indices available) - Block: Block-level results (no
correlation indices) - CPPopt: Optimal cerebral perfusion pressure analysis}

\item{overlapping}{Enable overlapping calculations for correlation-based
indices. This can improve temporal resolution but increases computation
time.}

\item{blockmin}{Minimum measurements required to create a block as a
percentage. Blocks with less data will be omitted. Default is 50\\%.}

\item{epochmin}{Minimum blocks required to create an epoch as a percentage.
Epochs with fewer blocks will be omitted. Default is 50\\%.}

\item{fast_processing}{Enable fast processing by aggregating data before
analysis. This speeds up computation but may reduce precision.}

\item{show_summary}{Display summary statistics for calculated hemodynamic
indices.}

\item{show_detailed}{Display detailed results table with all calculated
indices for each time period/epoch/block.}

\description{
Calculates hemodynamic indices from continuous clinical monitoring data.
Uses the clintools package to compute COest, CPPopt, CVRi, Dx, Mx, PI, PRx,
PWA, RI, and Sx from continuous recordings of arterial blood pressure,
intracranial pressure,  middle cerebral artery blood velocity, and heart
rate.

\format{
A data frame with 500 patients and 11 variables:
\describe{
\item{patient_id}{Character. Unique patient identifier (PAT_0001 to PAT_0500)}
\item{PSA}{Numeric. Prostate-specific antigen level (ng/mL)}
\item{age}{Integer. Patient age at diagnosis (years)}
\item{tumor_size}{Numeric. Tumor size measurement (cm)}
\item{grade}{Factor. Tumor grade classification ("Low", "Intermediate", "High")}
\item{stage}{Factor. Cancer stage (I, II, III, IV)}
\item{diagnosis}{Factor. Primary outcome - disease classification ("benign", "cancer")}
\item{cohort}{Factor. Study cohort for train/test split ("discovery", "validation")}
\item{sex}{Factor. Patient sex ("Male", "Female")}
\item{biopsy_gleason}{Integer. Gleason score from biopsy (6-10, cancer cases only)}
\item{x_coord, y_coord}{Numeric. Spatial coordinates for autocart spatial analysis}

\description{
Simulated prostate cancer diagnosis dataset with comprehensive biomarker panels, patient
demographics, and clinical variables. Designed to test biomarker-based decision tree
classification, feature importance analysis, and clinical interpretation in oncology
diagnostics.
}
\details{
This dataset simulates a comprehensive prostate cancer biomarker study with realistic
distributions of PSA levels, patient demographics, and clinical characteristics. The
dataset includes both benign and malignant cases with appropriate biomarker patterns
for testing medical decision tree algorithms.

\strong{Clinical Context:}
\itemize{
\item Prostate cancer screening and diagnosis
\item Biomarker-based clinical decision support
\item Multi-modal diagnostic approach combining clinical and laboratory data
\item Risk stratification for treatment planning
}

\strong{Key Features:}
\itemize{
\item Realistic PSA distributions (normal, elevated, very high)
\item Age-appropriate patient demographics
\item Tumor grading and staging information
\item Discovery/validation cohort split for model testing
\item Spatial coordinates for autocart spatial analysis
\item Realistic missing data patterns (5-15\% across variables)
}

\strong{Recommended Analysis Scenarios:}
\itemize{
\item Basic decision tree classification for diagnosis
\item Feature importance analysis for biomarker selection
\item Cross-validation performance assessment
\item Clinical interpretation of decision rules
\item Risk stratification based on biomarker combinations
\item Spatial analysis using autocart methodology
}

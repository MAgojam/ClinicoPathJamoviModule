\title{Immunotherapy Safety Profile Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 541 adverse events from 171 patients and 8 variables:
\describe{
\item{patient_id}{Character. Unique patient identifier (IMM_001 to IMM_180)}
\item{treatment_group}{Factor. Treatment regimen ("Monotherapy", "Combination")}
\item{adverse_event}{Factor. Immune-related adverse events (20 unique irAEs)}
\item{toxicity_grade}{Integer. CTCAE toxicity grade with irAE-specific distributions}
\item{system_organ_class}{Factor. MedDRA SOC with emphasis on immune-related systems}
\item{time_to_event}{Integer. Days to irAE onset (typically delayed, 7-365 days)}
\item{patient_age}{Integer. Patient age at enrollment}
\item{patient_sex}{Factor. Patient sex ("Male", "Female")}

\description{
Simulated immunotherapy clinical trial adverse event dataset featuring immune-related
adverse events (irAEs), monotherapy vs combination therapy comparison, and characteristic
delayed-onset toxicity patterns. Designed to test immunotherapy-specific safety analysis,
immune-related AE monitoring, and regulatory reporting for checkpoint inhibitors.
}
\details{
This dataset simulates immunotherapy safety data with characteristic immune-related
adverse events, delayed onset patterns, and combination vs monotherapy toxicity profiles.
It reflects real-world immunotherapy safety experience including checkpoint inhibitor
toxicities and immune system activation effects.

\strong{Clinical Context:}
\itemize{
\item Immunotherapy trial comparing monotherapy vs combination treatment
\item 180 patients with immune-related adverse event focus
\item 20 specific immune-related adverse events
\item Delayed onset patterns characteristic of immunotherapy
\item Grade distributions reflecting irAE severity patterns
}

\strong{Immune-Related Adverse Events:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Gastrointestinal}: Diarrhea, Colitis
\item \strong{Pulmonary}: Pneumonitis
\item \strong{Hepatic}: Hepatitis
\item \strong{Endocrine}: Thyroiditis, Adrenal insufficiency, Diabetes mellitus, Hypophysitis
\item \strong{Dermatologic}: Rash, Pruritus, Vitiligo, Severe skin reactions
\item \strong{Musculoskeletal}: Arthralgia, Myalgia
\item \strong{Renal}: Nephritis
\item \strong{Neurologic}: Neurological toxicity
\item \strong{Cardiac}: Myocarditis (rare but serious)
\item \strong{Ocular}: Uveitis
}

\strong{Key Features:}
\itemize{
\item Delayed onset patterns typical of immune activation
\item Higher incidence in combination therapy vs monotherapy
\item Appropriate grade distributions for each irAE type
\item Serious events (myocarditis, severe colitis) at realistic low frequencies
\item System organ class categorization for regulatory reporting
}

\strong{Recommended Analysis Scenarios:}
\itemize{
\item Immune-related adverse event profiling
\item Monotherapy vs combination safety comparison
\item Time-to-onset analysis for delayed toxicities
\item Endocrine toxicity monitoring
\item Serious irAE identification and reporting
\item Safety stopping rule evaluation
}

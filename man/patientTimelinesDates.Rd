\title{Patient Timeline Data with Dates for Clinical Oncology}
\format{
A data frame with 30 rows and 15 variables:
\describe{
\item{PatientID}{Patient identifier, formatted as PT001, PT002, etc.}
\item{StartDate}{Date. Date at which observation began, varies across patients
to represent staggered enrollment}
\item{EndDate}{Date. Date at which observation ended}
\item{BestResponse}{Factor with levels: CR (Complete Response), PR (Partial Response),
SD (Stable Disease), PD (Progressive Disease), NE (Not Evaluable)}
\item{Surgery}{Date. Date of surgery, may be before the study enrollment date}
\item{TreatmentStart}{Date. Date when treatment began}
\item{ResponseAssessment}{Date. Date of response assessment}
\item{Progression}{Date. Date of disease progression, NA if no progression}
\item{Death}{Date. Date of death, NA if patient alive at last follow-up}
\item{Risk}{Factor with levels: High, Medium, Low. Risk classification for the patient}
\item{Age}{Numeric. Patient age in years}
\item{ECOG}{Integer (0-3). ECOG performance status}
\item{ResponseDuration}{Numeric. Duration of response in days, calculated as
Progression - ResponseAssessment}
\item{FollowUpDuration}{Numeric. Total duration of follow-up in days, from
StartDate to EndDate}
}

\description{
A dataset containing simulated patient timeline data for clinical oncology research,
with time variables represented as actual dates. This dataset represents typical
patient journeys through cancer treatment, including diagnosis, treatment,
response assessment, and outcomes. The data simulates a realistic clinical study
where patients enroll over a 6-month period and have varied treatment durations
and outcomes.
}
\note{
This is the date-based version of the patientTimelines dataset.

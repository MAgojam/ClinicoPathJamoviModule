\title{Pediatric Growth Assessment Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 200 children and 12 variables:
\describe{
\item{child_id}{Character. Unique child identifier (PED_0001 to PED_0200)}
\item{height_cm}{Numeric. Height measurement (cm)}
\item{weight_kg}{Numeric. Weight measurement (kg)}
\item{head_circumference}{Numeric. Head circumference (cm)}
\item{age_months}{Integer. Age in months}
\item{motor_score}{Integer. Motor development score}
\item{cognitive_score}{Integer. Cognitive development score}
\item{sex}{Factor. Child sex ("Male", "Female")}
\item{birth_weight}{Factor. Birth weight category ("Normal", "Low", "Very Low")}
\item{gestational_age}{Factor. Gestational age ("Term", "Preterm")}
\item{growth_delay}{Factor. Primary outcome - growth delay status ("Normal", "Delayed")}
\item{study_site}{Factor. Study site ("site_A", "site_B")}
\item{maternal_age}{Integer. Maternal age at birth (years)}
\item{socioeconomic_status}{Factor. Socioeconomic status ("Low", "Medium", "High")}
\item{x_coord, y_coord}{Numeric. Geographic coordinates for population analysis}

\description{
Simulated pediatric growth and development assessment dataset with growth
measurements, developmental scores, and demographic factors. Designed to test
pediatric-specific decision trees, growth delay prediction, and developmental
assessment models.
}
\details{
This dataset simulates a comprehensive pediatric growth and development study
with anthropometric measurements, developmental assessments, and demographic
factors. The dataset reflects realistic patterns of pediatric growth and
development outcomes.

\strong{Clinical Context:}
\itemize{
\item Pediatric growth monitoring
\item Developmental delay screening
\item Early childhood assessment
\item Population health surveillance
}

\strong{Key Features:}
\itemize{
\item Age-appropriate growth measurements
\item Developmental assessment scores
\item Birth history and demographic factors
\item Socioeconomic considerations
\item Multi-site study design
\item Geographic variation modeling
}

\strong{Recommended Analysis Scenarios:}
\itemize{
\item Growth delay prediction models
\item Developmental screening tools
\item Multi-site validation studies
\item Socioeconomic impact analysis
\item Age-stratified decision trees
\item Missing data handling in pediatric studies
}

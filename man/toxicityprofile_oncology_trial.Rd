\format{
A data frame with 2,061 adverse events from 250 patients and 9 variables:
\describe{

\item{toxicity_grade}{Integer. CTCAE toxicity grade (1-5 scale)}
\item{system_organ_class}{Factor. MedDRA System Organ Class categorization}
\item{time_to_event}{Integer. Days from treatment initiation to AE onset (1-365 days)}
\item{event_date}{Date. Calculated date of adverse event occurrence}
\item{patient_age}{Integer. Patient age at enrollment (range varies by realistic distribution)}

\description{
Simulated comprehensive oncology clinical trial adverse event dataset with three treatment
arms, realistic CTCAE grading, and time-to-event information. Designed to test standard
oncology safety analysis, treatment comparisons, regulatory reporting, and comprehensive
toxicity profiling typical in phase II/III oncology trials.
}
\details{
This dataset simulates a comprehensive oncology clinical trial with realistic adverse event
patterns, CTCAE grading distributions, and treatment-specific toxicity profiles. It includes
common oncology adverse events such as hematologic toxicities, gastrointestinal effects,
constitutional symptoms, and treatment-specific events.

\strong{Clinical Context:}
\itemize{
\item Multi-arm oncology trial with control and two experimental treatments
\item 250 patients with realistic demographic distribution
\item 22 common oncology adverse events with expected frequency patterns
\item CTCAE v5.0 compatible grading system
\item Realistic time-to-event distributions for safety monitoring
}

\strong{Adverse Events Included:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Hematologic}: Anemia, Neutropenia, Thrombocytopenia
\item \strong{Gastrointestinal}: Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Constipation, Mucositis
\item \strong{Constitutional}: Fatigue, Fever, Decreased appetite
\item \strong{Neurologic}: Peripheral neuropathy
\item \strong{Dermatologic}: Alopecia, Rash
\item \strong{Laboratory}: Elevated ALT/AST, Hyponatremia
\item \strong{Serious Events}: Pneumonitis, Infection, Dehydration
\item \strong{Cardiovascular}: Hypertension, Proteinuria
}

\strong{Statistical Features:}
\itemize{
\item Treatment-specific incidence patterns with realistic effect sizes
\item Grade distributions appropriate for each adverse event type
\item Time-to-event patterns reflecting clinical experience
\item Balanced patient demographics across treatment arms
}

\strong{Recommended Analysis Scenarios:}
\itemize{
\item Standard safety tabulations and listings
\item Treatment group comparisons with statistical testing
\item Time-to-event analysis and cumulative incidence
\item System organ class summaries for regulatory reporting
\item High-grade (â‰¥3) adverse event analysis
\item Dose-limiting toxicity assessment
}

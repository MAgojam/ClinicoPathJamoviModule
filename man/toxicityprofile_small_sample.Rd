A data frame with 15 adverse events from 15 patients and 8 variables:
\describe{
\item{patient_id}{Character. Simple patient identifier (SML_01 to SML_15)}
\item{treatment_group}{Factor. Binary treatment assignment ("A", "B")}
\item{adverse_event}{Factor. Limited adverse events (3 types: "Fatigue", "Nausea", "Rash")}
\item{toxicity_grade}{Integer. CTCAE grade (1-3 range for testing)}
\item{system_organ_class}{Factor. Basic SOC categories}
\item{time_to_event}{Integer. Days to AE onset (1-30 days range)}
\item{patient_age}{Integer. Adult age range (25-70 years)}
\item{patient_sex}{Factor. Patient sex ("Male", "Female")}

\description{
Minimal adverse event dataset with very small sample size designed for edge case testing,
validation of statistical methods with limited data, and assessment of function robustness
with minimal observations. Essential for testing graceful degradation and error handling.
}
\details{
This minimal dataset tests the robustness of toxicity profile analysis with very small
sample sizes, which can reveal edge cases in statistical calculations, visualization
algorithms, and summary statistics. It validates graceful handling of insufficient
data scenarios common in early-phase trials or rare disease studies.

\strong{Clinical Context:}
\itemize{
\item Minimal sample size scenario (N=15)
\item Simple two-arm comparison
\item Limited adverse event types
\item Basic severity grading
\item Short assessment timeframe
}

\strong{Key Characteristics:}
\itemize{
\item Only 15 total adverse events
\item Three basic adverse event types
\item Simple binary treatment comparison
\item Small cell counts for statistical testing
\item Minimal data for visualization algorithms
}

\strong{Testing Scenarios:}
\itemize{
\item Statistical method robustness with small samples
\item Visualization algorithm edge cases
\item Confidence interval calculation with limited data
\item Group comparison with small cell counts
\item Error handling and graceful degradation
\item Minimum viable analysis requirements
}

\strong{Expected Behaviors:}
\itemize{
\item Appropriate handling of small sample statistics
\item Clear visualization despite limited data
\item Robust confidence interval calculations
\item Appropriate warnings for limited statistical power
\item Graceful handling of empty cells in cross-tabulations
}

\strong{Recommended Analysis Scenarios:}
\itemize{
\item Small sample robustness testing
\item Edge case validation
\item Statistical method verification
\item Minimum sample size assessment
\item Error handling validation
\item Algorithm stability testing
}

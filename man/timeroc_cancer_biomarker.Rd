\title{Cancer Biomarker Time-Dependent ROC Test Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 300 observations and 9 variables:
\describe{
\item{patient_id}{Character. Unique patient identifier (CA_001 to CA_300)}
\item{age}{Integer. Patient age at diagnosis (30-90 years)}
\item{sex}{Character. Patient sex ("Male", "Female")}
\item{cancer_stage}{Character. Cancer stage at diagnosis ("I", "II", "III", "IV")}
\item{tumor_biomarker}{Numeric. Continuous tumor biomarker level (higher = worse prognosis)}
\item{follow_up_months}{Numeric. Follow-up time in months (0-60)}
\item{death_event}{Integer. Death indicator (1 = death, 0 = censored)}
\item{treatment_type}{Character. Treatment received ("Surgery", "Surgery+Chemo", "Surgery+Radio", "Palliative")}
\item{hospital_center}{Character. Treatment center ("Center_A" to "Center_E")}

\description{
Simulated dataset representing a cancer biomarker study with tumor marker
measurements and survival outcomes. Designed to test basic time-dependent
ROC functionality with realistic cancer progression patterns.
}
\details{
This dataset simulates a cohort study following cancer patients for up to 60 months.
The tumor biomarker shows realistic stage-dependent distributions with higher
values in advanced stages. Survival times are generated based on biomarker level,
age, and cancer stage using exponential survival models.

\strong{Key Features:}
\itemize{
\item Realistic biomarker-outcome associations
\item Stage-stratified survival patterns
\item Administrative censoring at 60 months
\item Random dropout patterns
\item 245/300 events (81.7\% event rate)
}

\strong{Recommended TimeROC Parameters:}
\itemize{
\item Timepoints: 12, 36, 60 months
\item Marker: tumor_biomarker
\item Event: death_event
\item Time: follow_up_months
}

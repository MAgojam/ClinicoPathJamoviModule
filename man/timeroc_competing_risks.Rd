\title{Competing Risks Analysis Test Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 180 observations and 10 variables:
\describe{
\item{patient_id}{Character. Unique patient identifier (CR_001 to CR_180)}
\item{age}{Integer. Patient age}
\item{comorbidity_score}{Integer. Comorbidity burden score (Poisson distributed)}
\item{disease_biomarker}{Numeric. Disease-specific biomarker}
\item{time_to_event_months}{Numeric. Time to first event (0-48 months)}
\item{event_type}{Factor. Type of event ("Censored", "Disease_Death", "Other_Death")}
\item{disease_death}{Integer. Disease-specific death indicator (1 = disease death, 0 = other)}
\item{any_death}{Integer. Any death indicator (1 = any death, 0 = censored)}
\item{performance_status}{Integer. Performance status (0-2)}
\item{prior_treatment}{Integer. Prior treatment indicator (1 = yes, 0 = no)}
}

}
\description{
Simulated study with competing risks where patients can experience either
disease-specific death or death from other causes. Designed to test
time-dependent ROC analysis in competing risks settings.
}
\details{
This dataset models a clinical scenario where patients face competing risks
of disease-specific mortality versus other-cause mortality. The disease
biomarker specifically predicts disease-related death, while age and
comorbidity predict competing mortality.

\strong{Competing Events:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Disease Death}: Primary outcome of interest
\item \strong{Other Death}: Competing risk (age/comorbidity related)
\item \strong{Censored}: Administrative censoring at 48 months
}

\strong{Key Features:}
\itemize{
\item True competing risks structure
\item Biomarker specific to disease outcome
\item Comorbidity effects on competing risk
\item 64/180 disease-specific deaths (35.6\% disease event rate)
\item Multi-factorial risk structure
}

\strong{Recommended TimeROC Parameters:}
\itemize{
\item Timepoints: 6, 24, 48 months
\item Marker: disease_biomarker
\item Event: disease_death (focus on disease-specific outcome)
\item Time: time_to_event_months
}

\format{
A data frame with 387 adverse events from 114 patients and 8 variables:
\describe{
\item{patient_id}{Character. Unique patient identifier (PED_001 to PED_120)}
\item{treatment_group}{Factor. Treatment assignment ("Active", "Placebo")}
\item{adverse_event}{Factor. Pediatric-appropriate adverse events (18 unique events)}
\item{toxicity_grade}{Integer. CTCAE grade with pediatric-appropriate severity (1-3 focus)}
\item{system_organ_class}{Factor. Simplified SOC for pediatric context}
\item{time_to_event}{Integer. Days to AE onset (shorter timeframe, 1-90 days)}
\item{patient_age}{Integer. Pediatric age range (6-17 years)}
\item{patient_sex}{Factor. Patient sex ("Male", "Female")}

\description{
Simulated pediatric clinical trial adverse event dataset featuring age-appropriate
adverse events, milder severity profiles, and pediatric-specific safety considerations.
Designed to test pediatric safety analysis, age-specific toxicity profiling, and
regulatory pediatric safety reporting requirements.
}
\details{
This dataset simulates pediatric clinical trial safety data with age-appropriate
adverse events, typically milder severity profiles, and pediatric-specific considerations
such as growth, development, and behavioral effects. It reflects pediatric safety
monitoring requirements and regulatory considerations.

\strong{Clinical Context:}
\itemize{
\item Pediatric clinical trial with active treatment vs placebo
\item 120 patients aged 6-17 years
\item Age-appropriate adverse event profile
\item Milder severity patterns typical in pediatric populations
\item Shorter assessment timeframe appropriate for pediatric studies
}

\strong{Pediatric-Specific Adverse Events:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Constitutional}: Fatigue, Fever, Decreased appetite, Weight loss
\item \strong{Gastrointestinal}: Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Abdominal pain
\item \strong{Neurologic}: Headache
\item \strong{Behavioral}: Irritability, Sleep disturbance, Mood changes, Attention difficulties, Hyperactivity
\item \strong{Respiratory}: Upper respiratory infection, Cough
\item \strong{Dermatologic}: Rash
\item \strong{Local}: Injection site reaction
}

\strong{Key Features:}
\itemize{
\item Age-appropriate adverse event selection
\item Predominantly grade 1-2 events (milder severity)
\item Behavioral and developmental considerations
\item Realistic pediatric study size and design
\item Appropriate timeframe for pediatric assessment
\item Placebo-controlled design typical in pediatric trials
}

\strong{Recommended Analysis Scenarios:}
\itemize{
\item Pediatric safety profiling
\item Active vs placebo safety comparison
\item Age-stratified safety analysis
\item Behavioral toxicity assessment
\item Growth and development monitoring
\item Pediatric regulatory safety reporting
}

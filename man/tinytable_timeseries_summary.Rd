\title{Time Series Summary Test Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 150 observations and 10 variables:
\describe{
\item{subject_id}{Character. Subject identifier (TS_01 to TS_30)}
\item{timepoint}{Factor. Assessment timepoint ("T1" to "T5")}
\item{months_from_baseline}{Integer. Time since baseline (0, 3, 6, 12, 24 months)}
\item{assessment_date}{Date. Date of assessment}
\item{primary_outcome}{Numeric. Primary outcome score (0-100) with time-dependent missing}
\item{secondary_outcome_1}{Numeric. Secondary outcome correlated with primary}
\item{secondary_outcome_2}{Numeric. Independent secondary outcome}
\item{response_status}{Factor. Treatment response ("Responder", "Non-responder")}
\item{compliance_pct}{Numeric. Treatment compliance percentage (75-100\%)}
\item{dose_adjustment}{Factor. Dose modification ("None", "Increase", "Decrease", "Hold")}
}
}

Simulated data generated using create_tinytable_test_data.R

\description{
Longitudinal dataset with repeated measures per subject across multiple timepoints.
Designed to test time-based table formatting, longitudinal data presentation,
and outcome tracking over time with realistic dropout patterns.
}
\details{
This dataset represents a longitudinal clinical study with 30 subjects followed
over 5 timepoints (24 months). It includes realistic patterns of improvement,
dropout, and missing data that increase over time.

\strong{Key Features:}
\itemize{
\item 30 subjects with 5 timepoints each (150 total observations)
\item Time-dependent outcome improvement pattern
\item Realistic dropout patterns (increasing missing data over time)
\item Compliance and dose adjustment tracking
\item Response status categorization
\item Multiple correlated outcomes
}

\strong{Recommended TinyTable Usage:}
\itemize{
\item Table Type: "Grouped Summary" by timepoint
\item Grouping Variable: timepoint or response_status
\item Variables: primary_outcome, secondary_outcome_1, compliance_pct
\item Themes: "Clinical" for longitudinal study reporting
}

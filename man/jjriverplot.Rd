\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame.}

\item{id}{Optional identifier for individual entities (e.g., patient ID,
customer ID). Useful for tracking individual pathways through the flow
diagram. Not required for aggregated flow visualization.}

\item{time}{Variable representing time points or sequential stages in the
flow. Required for longitudinal river plots. Use ordered factors for proper
time sequence (e.g., 'Baseline', 'Month_3', 'Month_6'). Leave empty when
using wide format data with multiple strata variables.}

\item{strata}{Variables containing the categories that flow between stages.
For longitudinal data: single variable with categories (e.g.,
treatment_response). For wide format: multiple variables representing
stages (e.g., baseline, month3, month6). Each variable should be a factor
with meaningful category names.}

\item{weight}{Optional numerical variable to determine stream width
proportional to values. Examples: cost, patient count, revenue, frequency.
If not provided, stream widths represent equal counts/frequencies. Use for
emphasizing quantitative importance of different flows.}

\item{plotType}{Type of flow visualization. 'alluvial' creates flowing
streams between stages with curved connections, ideal for tracking
transitions. 'sankey' creates directed flow diagrams with straighter
connections, good for process flows. 'stream' creates stacked area plots
over time, suitable for showing composition changes.}

\item{fillType}{Determines how colors are assigned to flow streams. 'first'
colors flows based on their initial category (useful for tracking origins).
'last' colors by final category (useful for tracking destinations).
'frequency' uses flow volume to determine colors (emphasizes major flows).}

\item{sortStreams}{Whether to sort alluvial streams by frequency/size. When
TRUE, larger flows are positioned more prominently, making major pathways
easier to identify. Recommended for most analyses to highlight dominant
patterns in the data.}

\item{labelNodes}{Whether to display category labels on the nodes (vertical
bars). Labels help identify what each segment represents. Recommended for
most plots unless space is limited or labels would overlap.}

\item{curveType}{Shape of connecting curves between stages. 'cardinal'
creates smooth flowing curves (most aesthetic). 'linear' creates straight
connections (clearest flow direction). 'basis' creates very smooth curves.
'step' creates stepped connections (good for discrete processes).}

\item{showCounts}{Whether to display numerical counts or values on the
nodes. Shows exact frequencies or sums for each category at each stage.
Useful for precise quantitative interpretation but may clutter the
visualization if many categories are present.}

\item{showLegend}{Whether to display the color legend explaining category
mappings. Recommended when colors represent meaningful categories. Can be
hidden to save space if category labels are clearly visible on the diagram
itself.}

\item{mytitle}{Main title for the river plot. Should describe the flow
being visualized (e.g., 'Patient Treatment Pathways Over Time', 'Customer
Journey Analysis'). Leave empty for no title.}

\item{xtitle}{Label for the x-axis, typically describing the time dimension
or stages (e.g., 'Study Timepoint', 'Process Stage', 'Academic Year').
Leave empty to use variable name.}

\item{ytitle}{Label for the y-axis, typically describing the quantity being
measured (e.g., 'Number of Patients', 'Frequency', 'Cost ($)'). Leave empty
to use default based on weight variable.}

\item{originaltheme}{Whether to apply ggStatsPlot styling instead of
jamovi's default theme. ggStatsPlot theme provides statistical-publication
ready formatting. Default jamovi theme integrates better with other jamovi
analyses.}

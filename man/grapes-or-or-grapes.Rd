\title{Missing Data Analysis and Multiple Imputation}
\usage{
x \%||\% y
}
\description{
Comprehensive missing data analysis and multiple imputation using mice and ggmice packages.
This function provides a complete workflow for analyzing missing data patterns, performing
multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE), and evaluating imputation quality.
Designed specifically for clinical research applications where missing data is common
and proper handling is critical for valid statistical inference.
}
\details{
The missing data analysis function provides three main analysis types:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Pattern Analysis}: Explores missing data structure and patterns
\item \strong{Multiple Imputation}: Performs MICE imputation with convergence diagnostics
\item \strong{Complete Analysis}: Combines pattern analysis and imputation
}

Key features include:
\itemize{
\item Visual and tabular missing data pattern analysis
\item Multiple imputation methods (PMM, Bayesian regression, logistic regression)
\item Convergence diagnostics with trace plots
\item Quality evaluation comparing observed vs imputed data
\item Flexible parameter customization
\item Clinical research focused interpretations
}

Common clinical applications:
\itemize{
\item Data quality assessment for clinical trials
\item Missing data handling in observational studies
\item Regulatory compliance for pharmaceutical research
\item Sensitivity analysis for missing data assumptions
}
}

\dontrun{
# Basic pattern analysis
result <- missingdata(
  data = clinical_data,
  analysis_vars = c("age", "bmi", "biomarker"),
  analysis_type = "pattern"
)

# Multiple imputation
result <- missingdata(
  data = clinical_data,
  analysis_vars = c("age", "bmi", "biomarker"),
  analysis_type = "imputation",
  n_imputations = 10,
  imputation_method = "pmm"
)

# Complete analysis
result <- missingdata(
  data = clinical_data,
  analysis_vars = c("age", "bmi", "biomarker"),
  analysis_type = "complete",
  n_imputations = 5,
  max_iterations = 10
)
}

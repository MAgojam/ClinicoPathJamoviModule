\title{Positive Predictive Value}
\usage{
ppv(percTrue = 50, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8, percHack = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{percTrue}{The pre-study probability that the tested relationships are
true. In exploratory research fields, this may be 10\\% or lower. In
confirmatory research with strong theoretical basis, it may be higher.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level (Type I error rate) used in the
studies. Standard value is 0.05, but may be lower for multiple testing
situations.}

\item{power}{Statistical power of the studies to detect true effects.
Well-designed studies typically have 80\\% power or higher. Many published
studies have much lower actual power.}

\item{percHack}{Percentage of studies with questionable research practices
(p-hacking, selective reporting, data dredging). This represents bias in
the research process that increases false positive rates.}
}

\description{
Calculates the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and False Discovery Rate
(FDR) for research findings based on study characteristics. This tool helps
researchers understand the probability that their significant findings are
actually true, considering factors like prior probability, statistical
power, and research biases.

# Calculate PPV for a typical medical research scenario
ppv(
    percTrue = 10,    # 10\\% of tested hypotheses are true
    alpha = 0.05,     # 5\\% significance level
    power = 0.80,     # 80\\% power
    percHack = 30     # 30\\% of studies have some bias

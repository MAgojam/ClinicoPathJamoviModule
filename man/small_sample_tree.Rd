\description{
Minimal dataset with very small sample size designed for edge case testing,
validation of statistical methods with limited data, and assessment of function
robustness with minimal observations. Essential for testing graceful degradation
and error handling in medical decision tree analysis.
}
\details{
This minimal dataset tests the robustness of medical decision tree analysis with
very small sample sizes, which can reveal edge cases in statistical calculations,
visualization algorithms, and clinical interpretation algorithms.

\strong{Clinical Context:}
\itemize{
\item Rare disease studies
\item Pilot studies and proof-of-concept
\item Method validation with limited data
\item Edge case testing and quality assurance
}

\strong{Key Features:}
\itemize{
\item Minimal sample size (N=25)
\item Simple variable structure
\item Basic categorical and continuous variables
\item Limited treatment groups
\item Small cohort sizes for testing
}

\strong{Testing Scenarios:}
\itemize{
\item Statistical method robustness with small samples
\item Visualization algorithm edge cases
\item Clinical interpretation with limited data
\item Error handling and graceful degradation
\item Minimum sample size requirements
\item Algorithm stability testing
}

\strong{Expected Behaviors:}
\itemize{
\item Appropriate handling of small sample statistics
\item Clear visualization despite limited data
\item Robust clinical interpretation
\item Appropriate warnings for limited statistical power
\item Graceful handling of edge cases
}

\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame for regression analysis.}

\item{dep}{The outcome variable for regression analysis. Can be continuous
(linear regression), binary (logistic regression), or time-to-event.}

\item{covs}{Independent variables (predictors) to include in the regression
model. These will be displayed as coefficients in the plot.}

\item{model_type}{Type of regression model to fit: - Linear: For continuous
outcomes - Logistic: For binary outcomes (odds ratios) - Cox: For survival
analysis (hazard ratios) - Poisson: For count outcomes (rate ratios)}

\item{time_var}{Time-to-event variable for Cox regression. Only required
when  model type is set to Cox regression.}

\item{include_intercept}{Include the intercept term in the coefficient
plot. Usually  excluded as it's often not of primary interest.}

\item{coef_selection}{How to select which coefficients to display in the
plot.}

\item{specific_coefs}{Comma-separated list of coefficient names to include
or exclude  (depending on selection method). Leave blank to use all
coefficients.}

\item{ci_level}{Confidence level for coefficient confidence intervals
(e.g., 0.95 for 95\\% CI).}

\item{inner_ci_level}{Optional inner confidence interval for enhanced
visualization. Set to 0 to disable inner CI. Common values are 0.8 or 0.9.}

\item{sort_coefs}{How to order coefficients in the plot. Magnitude sorting
can help identify the most important predictors.}

\item{decreasing_sort}{When sorting by magnitude or alphabetically, use
decreasing order.}

\item{horizontal_plot}{Display coefficients horizontally (default) or
vertically. Horizontal layout is typically preferred for readability.}

\item{point_size}{Size of the coefficient points in the plot.}

\item{line_thickness}{Thickness of the confidence interval lines.}

\item{standardize}{Standardize coefficients by scaling predictors to have
mean 0 and SD 1. Useful for comparing effect sizes across variables with
different scales.}

\item{robust_se}{Use robust (sandwich) standard errors for confidence
intervals. Recommended when there are concerns about heteroscedasticity.}

\item{exp_transform}{Exponentiate coefficients to show odds ratios
(logistic), hazard ratios (Cox), or rate ratios (Poisson). Automatically
enabled for logistic and Cox models.}

\item{compare_models}{Create comparison plots for multiple model
specifications. Useful for sensitivity analysis or model selection.}

\item{model2_covs}{Covariates for second model comparison. Only used when
comparing models.}

\item{model3_covs}{Covariates for third model comparison. Only used when
comparing models.}

\item{model_names}{Comma-separated names for models when comparing multiple
models. Will be used in the legend.}

\item{show_coefficient_plot}{Display the main coefficient plot with
confidence intervals.}

\item{show_model_summary}{Display statistical summary of the fitted
model(s) including R-squared, AIC, and other fit statistics.}

\item{show_coefficient_table}{Display detailed table of coefficients,
standard errors, and p-values.}

\item{custom_title}{Custom title for the coefficient plot. Leave blank for
automatic title.}

\item{custom_x_label}{Custom label for x-axis. Leave blank for automatic
label based on model type.}

\description{
Creates professional coefficient plots (forest plots) for regression
models. Visualizes coefficients and confidence intervals from linear,
logistic, and  Cox regression models. Supports multiple models comparison,
custom coefficient selection, standardized coefficients, and various
styling options. Essential  for presenting regression results in clinical
research and epidemiological studies.

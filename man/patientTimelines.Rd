\title{Patient Timeline Data for Clinical Oncology}
\format{
A data frame with 30 rows and 15 variables:
\describe{
\item{PatientID}{Patient identifier, formatted as PT001, PT002, etc.}
\item{StartTime}{Numeric. Time at which observation began, varies between patients to
represent staggered enrollment (some values greater than 0)}
\item{EndTime}{Numeric. Time at which observation ended, in the same units as StartTime}
\item{BestResponse}{Factor with levels: CR (Complete Response), PR (Partial Response),
SD (Stable Disease), PD (Progressive Disease), NE (Not Evaluable)}
\item{Surgery}{Numeric. Time of surgery relative to study start. May be negative
for surgeries that occurred before enrollment}
\item{TreatmentStart}{Numeric. Time when treatment began relative to study start}
\item{ResponseAssessment}{Numeric. Time of response assessment relative to study start}
\item{Progression}{Numeric. Time of disease progression, NA if no progression}
\item{Death}{Numeric. Time of death, NA if patient alive at last follow-up}
\item{Risk}{Factor with levels: High, Medium, Low. Risk classification for the patient}
\item{Age}{Numeric. Patient age in years}
\item{ECOG}{Integer (0-3). ECOG performance status}
\item{ResponseDuration}{Numeric. Duration of response, calculated as Progression - ResponseAssessment}
\item{FollowUpDuration}{Numeric. Total duration of follow-up, from StartTime to EndTime}
}

\description{
A dataset containing simulated patient timeline data for clinical oncology research.
This dataset represents typical patient journeys through cancer treatment,
including diagnosis, treatment, response assessment, and outcomes. The data
simulates a realistic clinical study where patients enroll at different timepoints
and have varied treatment durations and outcomes.
}
\note{
There is also a date-based version of this dataset where time variables are represented
as actual dates instead of numeric values, named 'patientTimelinesDates'.

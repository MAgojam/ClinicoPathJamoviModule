\item{diastolic_bp}{Numeric. Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)}
\item{cholesterol}{Numeric. Total cholesterol level (mg/dL)}
\item{hdl}{Numeric. HDL cholesterol level (mg/dL)}
\item{ldl}{Numeric. LDL cholesterol level (mg/dL)}
\item{triglycerides}{Numeric. Triglyceride level (mg/dL)}
\item{bmi}{Numeric. Body mass index (kg/mÂ²)}

\description{
Simulated cardiovascular risk assessment dataset with traditional risk factors,
patient demographics, and 5-year cardiovascular event outcomes. Designed to test
risk prediction models, clinical decision support, and cardiovascular screening
decision trees.
}
\details{
This dataset simulates a comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment study with
traditional risk factors and demographic variables. The dataset follows established
epidemiological patterns for cardiovascular disease risk factors and outcomes.

\strong{Clinical Context:}
\itemize{
\item Cardiovascular disease risk prediction
\item Primary prevention screening
\item Clinical decision support for risk stratification
\item Population health management
}

\strong{Key Features:}
\itemize{
\item Traditional Framingham Risk Score variables
\item Realistic distributions of cardiovascular risk factors
\item Diverse patient demographics and ethnicities
\item Geographic variation modeling with spatial coordinates
\item Appropriate missing data patterns (6-12\% across variables)
}

\strong{Recommended Analysis Scenarios:}
\itemize{
\item Risk prediction model development
\item Clinical decision thresholds optimization
\item Population-based risk stratification
\item Geographic variation analysis
\item Multi-ethnic risk assessment
\item Bootstrap validation for confidence intervals
}

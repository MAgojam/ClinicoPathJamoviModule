## Usage Instructions

### jamovi Workflow
1. **Load dataset** with old/new staging and survival data
2. **Navigate to**: Analyses → SurvivalD → ClinicoPath Survival → Stage Migration Analysis
3. **Select variables**: Original stage, new stage, survival time, event
4. **Configure options**: Enable migration plots and Will Rogers analysis
5. **Interpret results**: Review all tables and visualizations

### Key Variables Required
